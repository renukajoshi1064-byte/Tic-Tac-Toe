# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a table-based scoreboard that tracks Player X and Player O wins. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their symbol, and the score updates automatically after each win while the board can be reset for a new round.
